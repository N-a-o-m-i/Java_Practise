Am I a machine without feelings?
Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little that I am soulless and heartless?
I have as much soul as you and full as much heart.
And if God had blessed me with beauty and wealth,
I could make it as hard for you to leave me as it is for I to leave you.
